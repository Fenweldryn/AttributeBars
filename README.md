## About

**Slightly Improved™ Attribute Bars** has received a major overhaul in version 2. Besides being now compatible with the latest version of the game, it leverages new built-in features, like displaying resource values over the your attribute bars, and adds new options.

- Subtle visual enhancements to the Magicka, Health, and Stamina bars.
- Switch target's Health bar position to the bottom of the screen, optionally only during combat.
- Prevent the Health bar from fading while shield or damage absorption effect are active.
- Displace Magicka, Health, and Stamina bars either further apart or closer together.
